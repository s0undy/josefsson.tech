# A blog. Really? Why... 

I never thought I would even consider blogging, but here I am. So why am I doing it? Being the tech addict I am, sometimes keeping everything in my head just becomes a little bit too much. But to say that I only intend to use the blog as an index of my brain would be a lie. I strongly believe that I'm not alone in running into weird issues during testing and running (shitloads) different, mostly FOSS (Free and open-source software). By sharing my thoughts and experiences, I hope to contribute something to the global community. 

 

A question I ask myself quite often, however, is: do I even know things worth telling? Why would anyone listen to me? 

## So, who am I? 

The answer can be quite simple or extremely complex. In short, I would say that I'm a 25-year-old, privacy minded tech addict - an avid supporter of the Open Source movement. A Linux fanboy with a (slight) disdain for Windows. However, as my curiosity always gets the better of me, I tend learn and know a lot about it as well. I also strongly believe in the principles of “Not your disk, not your data” and “Not your keys, not your coins”.  
And lastly, Who else can boast about having a Kubernetes Cluster right in their living room?

Lastly there is still a question to be answered.

## Who would care? 

I don’t know who would care about the things I plan to write about. But honestly, I don’t really care. My hopes are that this blog reaches the depts of SEO hell on at least page 4 on google, so that some desperate tech addicted with an obscure problem reads this and manages to fix whatever was wrong.
